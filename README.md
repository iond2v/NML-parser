# NML-parser
<h4>Parse Traktor .nml file into simple 'Artist - Track' list in txt file named the same as the original nml file.</h4>



* You need Python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

  * When installing, check put Python into PATH.



* Then just run the nml_parser.py in the folder with all your .nml files.

* All nml files that do not already have txt playlist generated will be processed.

* Ignores other folders and any files other than txt and nml.

* Should be safe. It only reads the original files without modifying or deleting anything.
