# NML-parser
Parse Traktor .nml file into simple 'Artist - Track' list in txt file named the same as the original nml file.


You need Python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

When installing, check put Python into PATH.


Then just run this in the folder with all your .nml files.

All nml files that do not already have txt playlist generated will be processed.

Ignores other folders and any files other than txt and nml.

Should be safe. It only reads the original files without modifying or deleting anything.
